### :wave: Hey there! I'm a self-taught Flutter Developer with 1 year of experience in Flutter and more than 5 years of experience in mobile app development in general. Here's a bit of what I've been working on.

## Alkitab PEDIA

Alkitab PEDIA is an app developed by SABDA that introduces all of the books of the Bible from Genesis to Revelation. It highlights key elements of the literature, history, and various theological and analytical insights on every book and chapter in the Bible.

This app is currently in development. There are two different versions of the app for Android and iOS, but the iOS version is lacking some features. I'm contributing to bring these features and some more.

## Tafsiran Alkitab

Tafsiran is a Bible commentary app developed by SABDA. It provides a range of Bible commentaries from various authors for deeper study. It's a favorite app for many people who studies the Bible, having over 500,000 downloads on the Google Play Store.

This app is currently exclusive to Android, and I'm working with them to bring the app to iOS while adding more features to it.

## Renungan PSM (Pagi, Siang, Malam)

Renungan PSM is a daily devotional app developed by SABDA. This app is designed to provide devotional readings for three times a day&mdash;in the morning, at noon, and in the evening.
